Okay, let's clarify "license dart". There are two main interpretations:

1.  **The license under which the Dart SDK itself is distributed.**
2.  **How to add a license to your own Dart project.**

Let's cover both:

**1. The Dart SDK License**

*   The Dart SDK (Software Development Kit), developed primarily by Google, is distributed under a **permissive, custom 3-clause BSD-style license**.
*   You can find the full text of the license here: [https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/LICENSE](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/LICENSE)
*   **Key characteristics of BSD-style licenses:**
    *   **Permissive:** They place very few restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, and redistributed.
    *   **Allows Commercial Use:** You can use Dart to build proprietary, closed-source applications.
    *   **Requires Attribution:** You generally need to retain the original copyright notice and the license text if you redistribute the Dart SDK source code itself (which is rare for most end-users).
    *   **No Warranty/Liability:** Like most open-source licenses, it comes with no warranty and disclaims liability.

**In simple terms:** Google makes Dart available under a very friendly license that allows almost anyone to use it for almost any purpose, free of charge, without needing to share their own source code back.

**2. Adding a License to YOUR Dart Project**

When you create your own project using Dart (a library, a command-line tool, a Flutter app, etc.), **you need to choose a license for *your* code.** The Dart SDK's license doesn't automatically apply to your creation.

**Why add a license?**

*   **Clarity:** It tells others what they can and cannot do with your code (use, copy, modify, distribute).
*   **Legal Protection:** It provides a basic legal framework. Without a license, the default is usually "all rights reserved," which severely limits usability for others.
*   **Open Source Compliance:** If you use other open-source libraries, their licenses might require your project to also have a compatible open-source license.

**How to add a license:**

1.  **Choose a License:** Decide how permissive or restrictive you want to be. Some popular choices for Dart/Flutter projects:
    *   **Permissive (Recommended for libraries):**
        *   **MIT License:** Very simple, short, and widely used. Allows nearly anything as long as the original license and copyright notice are included.
        *   **Apache License 2.0:** Also permissive, but more verbose than MIT. Includes an express grant of patent rights.
        *   **BSD 3-Clause / BSD 2-Clause:** Similar to MIT, slightly different wording.
    *   **Copyleft (Requires sharing changes under the same license):**
        *   **GNU GPLv3 (General Public License):** If someone distributes software using your GPL-licensed code, they must make their source code available under the same GPL license. Less common for Dart libraries, sometimes used for full applications.
        *   **GNU AGPLv3 (Affero General Public License):** Similar to GPL but also applies to software used over a network (SaaS).

2.  **Create a `LICENSE` File:**
    *   Create a plain text file named `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.md`) in the root directory of your project.
    *   Copy the **full text** of the license you chose into this file.
    *   Replace any placeholders (like `[year]` and `[fullname]`, `[copyright holders]`) with your information. For example, for MIT:
        ```
        MIT License

        Copyright (c) [year] [your name or company name]

        Permission is hereby granted... [rest of the MIT license text] ...
        ```

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Add License Headers:** You can add a short comment block at the top of your `.dart` source files indicating the license.
    ```dart
    // Copyright (c) [year] [your name or company name]
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    // OR: // Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

    // ... your Dart code starts here ...
    ```
    *Note: SPDX identifiers are standard ways to refer to licenses.*

4.  **Commit the `LICENSE` File:** Add the `LICENSE` file to your version control system (like Git).

5.  **Update `pubspec.yaml` (Good Practice):** While `pub.dev` primarily detects the `LICENSE` file, ensure your `repository:` link in `pubspec.yaml` points to where users can find the license (usually your GitHub/GitLab repo root).

By adding a `LICENSE` file, platforms like GitHub and `pub.dev` will often automatically detect and display the license type for your project.
