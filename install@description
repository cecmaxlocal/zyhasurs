Okay, here are the common ways to install the Dart SDK:

**Method 1: Install via the Flutter SDK (Most Common for Flutter Development)**

If you plan to do Flutter development (for mobile, web, or desktop apps), the easiest way is to install the Flutter SDK. **Flutter includes its own version of the Dart SDK.**

1.  **Go to the Flutter installation page:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2.  **Follow the specific instructions for your operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3.  During the setup, you'll be asked to add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
4.  **Once Flutter is installed and configured correctly, the `dart` command will automatically be available** in your terminal or command prompt.

    ```bash
    # Verify Flutter installation (which includes Dart)
    flutter doctor

    # Verify Dart installation specifically
    dart --version
    ```

**Method 2: Install the Standalone Dart SDK (for Dart Backend, CLI tools, etc.)**

If you only need Dart (e.g., for command-line tools, server-side development with frameworks like Aqueduct/Serverpod, or web development without Flutter), you can install the Dart SDK directly.

Choose the instructions for your operating system:

**A) Windows:**

*   **Using Chocolatey (Recommended):**
    1.  Make sure you have Chocolatey installed ([https://chocolatey.org/install](https://chocolatey.org/install)).
    2.  Open PowerShell or Command Prompt **as Administrator**.
    3.  Run:
        ```powershell
        choco install dart-sdk
        ```
    4.  Close and reopen your terminal. Verify with `dart --version`.

*   **Using Scoop:**
    1. Make sure you have Scoop installed ([https://scoop.sh/](https://scoop.sh/)).
    2. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
    3. Run:
       ```powershell
       scoop install dart
       ```
    4. Close and reopen your terminal. Verify with `dart --version`.

*   **Manual Download (Zip):**
    1.  Go to the Dart SDK archive page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive](https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive)
    2.  Download the `.zip` file for the latest stable release for Windows (x64 or ia32).
    3.  Extract the `dart-sdk` folder to a location on your computer (e.g., `C:\dart-sdk`).
    4.  **Add the `dart-sdk\bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.**
        *   Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.
        *   Click "Edit the system environment variables".
        *   Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
        *   Under "System variables" (or "User variables" if preferred), find the `Path` variable, select it, and click "Edit...".
        *   Click "New" and add the full path to the `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\dart-sdk\bin`).
        *   Click OK on all dialogs.
    5.  Close and reopen **all** Command Prompt or PowerShell windows. Verify with `dart --version`.

**B) macOS:**

*   **Using Homebrew (Recommended):**
    1.  Make sure you have Homebrew installed ([https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)).
    2.  Open your Terminal.
    3.  Run:
        ```bash
        brew tap dart-lang/dart
        brew install dart
        ```
    4.  Verify with `dart --version`.

*   **Manual Download (Zip):**
    1.  Go to the Dart SDK archive page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive](https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive)
    2.  Download the `.zip` file for the latest stable release for macOS (x64 or arm64).
    3.  Extract the `dart-sdk` folder (e.g., to `~/dart-sdk` or `/usr/local/dart-sdk`).
    4.  **Add the `dart-sdk/bin` directory to your PATH.** Edit your shell configuration file (like `~/.zshrc` for Zsh (default on newer macOS) or `~/.bash_profile` for Bash). Add a line like this (replace `/path/to/` with the actual path):
        ```bash
        export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/dart-sdk/bin"
        ```
    5.  Save the file and run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`) or open a new terminal window.
    6.  Verify with `dart --version`.

**C) Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

*   **Using `apt-get` (Recommended):**
    1.  Open your Terminal.
    2.  Update package lists and install HTTPS support:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
        ```
    3.  Add the Google signing key:
        ```bash
        sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/dart.gpg'
        ```
    4.  Add the Dart repository:
        ```bash
        echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/dart.gpg arch=amd64] https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list
        ```
    5.  Update package lists again and install Dart:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install dart
        ```
    6.  Verify with `dart --version`.

*   **Manual Download (Zip):**
    1.  Go to the Dart SDK archive page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive](https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive)
    2.  Download the `.zip` file for the latest stable release for Linux (x64 or ia32, arm, arm64).
    3.  Extract the `dart-sdk` folder (e.g., to `~/dart-sdk` or `/usr/local/dart-sdk`).
    4.  **Add the `dart-sdk/bin` directory to your PATH.** Edit your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). Add a line like this (replace `/path/to/` with the actual path):
        ```bash
        export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/dart-sdk/bin"
        ```
    5.  Save the file and run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc`) or open a new terminal window.
    6.  Verify with `dart --version`.

**Verification:**

After installation using any method, open a **new** terminal/command prompt window and run:

```bash
dart --version
```

You should see the installed Dart SDK version printed.
