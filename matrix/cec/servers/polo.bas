' **Examining the Core Task**

' I've zeroed in on the fundamental goal: constructing a FreeBASIC program, `polo.bas`. 
' My focus is now on dissecting the request's core components to build a robust outline. 
' This includes understanding the specific requirements implied by the program's name and 
' any other contextual hints. I'm keen on establishing the essential functions and 
' structure needed.


' **Defining Program Functionality**

' I'm now clarifying the program's intended behavior based on the "Marco Polo" association. 
' It's a call-and-response game within a loop, prompting me to think about user input, 
' output, and game logic. I'm focusing on creating an effective loop structure and 
' incorporating appropriate prompts and responses. This should also include handling 
' the "lo" interpretation as a potential typo or misunderstanding.


' **Structuring the Interaction**

' I'm now building the program's skeleton. My aim is to define the core loop, 
' incorporating "Marco!" and user input, readying for the "Polo!" response. This 
' foundational design will allow for easy expansion. I'm focusing on the input-output 
' dynamics for clarity.


' **Refining Program Logic**

' I'm now integrating the counter and the exit condition, shaping the final game flow. 
' The main focus is on maintaining clarity in the game's loop structure. I'll test the 
' loop's behaviour rigorously and ensure that the "quit" command functions correctly.


' **Constructing the Game Loop**

' I'm now focusing on the main loop structure, integrating input validation and the 
' counter increment. Using `UCase` and `Trim`, I've enhanced the user input handling, 
' making the game more robust. My aim is to ensure that the game responds correctly, 
' regardless of the user's typing style.


' **Implementing Input Handling**

' I'm now focusing on user input. I've integrated `UCase` and `Trim` for robust input 
' handling, and have established the main game structure. I've also incorporated a "Marco!" 
' prompt and the basic loop. I'm testing the game and making minor adjustments to the 
' game's flow and response.


' **Constructing the Game Logic**

' I'm now implementing the loop structure, incorporating the "Marco!" and "Polo!" 
' responses and a counter. I'm focusing on creating an exit condition, such as "quit", 
' for the user. I'm also preparing for the compilation and example sections to make 
' the process clear. I've designed and refined the game's core logic.


' **Implementing the Core Game Loop**

' I've finalized the game loop structure, integrating the core "Marco!" prompt, user 
' input capture, and the "Polo!" response. I'm focusing on crafting a clear, engaging 
' flow. Also, the integration of `UCase` and `Trim` ensures more robust input validation 
' and user-friendliness.



' Of course. Here is a complete package for the `polo.bas` program in FreeBASIC, 
' including a description, the source code, compilation instructions, and examples.

' ### 1. `polo.bas`: Program Description

' `polo.bas` is a simple, interactive command-line game based on the classic children's game "Marco Polo".

' The program works in a loop:
' 1.  It prints "Marco!" to the screen.
' 2.  It waits for the user to type a response.
' 3.  If the user correctly types "Polo!", the program acknowledges it and starts the next round.
' 4.  If the user types anything else, the program corrects them.
' 5.  The game continues in a loop until the user types "exit" or "quit".

' This script is an excellent example for beginners to understand basic FreeBASIC concepts like loops (`Do...Loop`), user input (`Input`), string manipulation (`UCase`, `Trim`), and conditional logic (`Select Case`).

' ### 2. The FreeBASIC Script (`polo.bas`)

' Create a new text file, name it `polo.bas`, and copy the following code into it.

' ```freebasic
' polo.bas
' A simple, looping "Marco Polo" game in FreeBASIC.
'
' This demonstrates loops, user input, and conditional logic.

' Use the modern "fb" language dialect.
#lang "fb"

' Declare variables
Dim As String user_input
Dim As Integer round_counter = 1

' --- Program Start ---

' Print a welcome message
Print "==========================="
Print "  Let's play Marco Polo!"
Print "==========================="
Print "I will say 'Marco!'. You must respond with 'Polo!'."
Print "Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the game."
Print

' The main game loop
Do
    ' Display the game's prompt for the current round
    Print "Round " & round_counter & ": Marco!"

    ' Get input from the user with a ">" prompt
    Input "> ", user_input

    ' Sanitize the user's input:
    ' Trim() removes any leading/trailing spaces.
    ' UCase() converts the string to UPPERCASE to make the check case-insensitive.
    user_input = UCase(Trim(user_input))

    ' Check the user's response
    Select Case user_input
        Case "POLO"
            ' Correct answer
            Print "    Correct! Let's go again."
            Print
            round_counter += 1 ' Increment the round counter

        Case "EXIT", "QUIT"
            ' User wants to exit the game
            Print "    Okay, game over."
            Exit Do ' Exit the Do...Loop

        Case Else
            ' Incorrect answer
            Print "    Nope! The correct response is 'Polo!'."
            Print "    Let's try this round again."
            Print

    End Select
Loop

' --- Program End ---

' Final message after the loop has ended
Print
Print "Thanks for playing!"

' Pause the program for 2 seconds before closing the console window.
' This gives the user time to read the final message.
Sleep 2000
End
' ```

' ### 3. How to Compile and Run

' To compile and run this script, you need to have the FreeBASIC compiler (`fbc`) installed.

' 1.  **Save the Code**: Save the code above into a file named `polo.bas`.

' 2.  **Open a Terminal**:
'     *   On **Windows**, open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) or PowerShell.
'     *   On **Linux** or **macOS**, open a Terminal.

' 3.  **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you saved `polo.bas`.
'     ```sh
'     cd path\to\your\folder
'     ```

' 4.  **Compile the Script**: Use the FreeBASIC compiler (`fbc`) to create an executable file.
'     ```sh
'     fbc polo.bas
'     ```
'     If there are no errors, this will create `polo.exe` on Windows or `polo` on Linux/macOS.

' 5.  **Run the Program**:
'     *   On **Windows**:
'         ```sh
'         polo.exe
'         ```
'     *   On **Linux/macOS**:
'         ```sh
'         ./polo
'         ```

'     Nope! The correct response is 'Polo!'.
'     Let's try this round again.

' Round 1: Marco!
' > Polo
'     Correct! Let's go again.

' Round 2: Marco!
' > exit
'     Okay, game over.
