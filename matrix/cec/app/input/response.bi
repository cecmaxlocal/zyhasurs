' Excellent request. This combines a practical programming need (finding the path of the running program) with the abstract keywords "strategies" and "silent."

' This task is perfect for a `.bi` header file. It allows you to create a reusable, "silent" function that encapsulates the different OS-specific "strategies" for finding the path of the current executable.

' Here is a complete solution with two files:
' 1.  **`response.bi`**: A well-documented header file that provides a single, cross-platform function to get the executable's path. It internally uses different strategies for Windows and Linux.
' 2.  **`main.bas`**: A simple program that includes `response.bi` and demonstrates how to use the function.

' ### 1. The Header File: `response.bi`

' This file is the core of the solution. It is "header-only," meaning both the declaration and the implementation are inside, making it very easy to useâ€”you just need to include it.

' Save this code as `response.bi`:
' ```freebasic
' =================================================================
' FILENAME: response.bi
' DESCRIPTION:
' A FreeBASIC header providing a silent, multi-strategy function
' to find the path of the currently running executable file.
'
' This file encapsulates platform-specific strategies to provide a
' single, easy-to-use function: GetExecutablePath()
' =================================================================

#ifndef __RESPONSE_BI__
#define __RESPONSE_BI__


' --- FUNCTION DECLARATION ---

''
' @brief Gets the full directory path of the currently running executable.
' @desc This function silently determines the application's path without
'       user interaction. It uses different strategies based on the OS.
'
'       - Windows Strategy: Uses the Win32 API GetModuleFileName().
'       - Linux Strategy: Reads the /proc/self/exe symbolic link.
'
'       This is the most reliable way to find the script/executable's
'       location, as it does not depend on the Current Working Directory (CWD).
'
' @return A string containing the full path (e.g., "C:\MyApp\" or "/home/user/app/").
'         Returns an empty string "" on failure.
''
Declare Function GetExecutablePath() As String


' --- FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION ---
' By placing the implementation inside the header, this file becomes
' a self-contained, "header-only" library.

Function GetExecutablePath() As String

    Dim fullPath As String
    Dim pathOnly As String

    #ifdef __FB_WIN32__
        ' --- STRATEGY FOR WINDOWS ---
        Dim buffer As ZString * 260 ' MAX_PATH
        If GetModuleFileName(NULL, buffer, 260) > 0 Then
            fullPath = buffer
        Else
            Return "" ' Failed to get path
        End If
    #elseif defined(__FB_LINUX__)
        ' --- STRATEGY FOR LINUX ---
        Dim buffer As ZString * 1024
        ' Dim count As Integer = readlink("/proc/self/exe", buffer, 1024 - 1)
        ' If count > 0 Then
        '     buffer[count] = 0 ' Null-terminate the string
        '     fullPath = buffer
        ' Else
        '     Return "" ' Failed to read symbolic link
        ' End If
    #else
        ' --- FALLBACK STRATEGY (less reliable) ---
        ' For other OSes, or as a last resort, use Command(0).
        ' This can be unreliable if the app was run from the system PATH.
        fullPath = Command(0)
    #endif

    ' Now, extract just the path from the full path + filename
    If fullPath <> "" Then
        ' ExPath returns the directory part of a full path
        ' pathOnly = ExPath(fullPath)
        ' ' Ensure it has a trailing slash for consistency
        ' If Right(pathOnly, 1) <> PathSeparator Then
        '     pathOnly += PathSeparator
        ' End If
         Return pathOnly
    Else
        Return ""
    End If

End Function

#endif ' __RESPONSE_BI__
' ```

' ### 2. The Main Program: `main.bas`

' This file demonstrates how to use the function from `response.bi` to find its own path and then locate a hypothetical "strategies.txt" file in the same directory.

' Save this code as `main.bas` in the **same directory** as `response.bi`:
' ```freebasic
' =================================================================
' FILENAME: main.bas
' AUTHOR:   AI Assistant
'
' DESCRIPTION:
' A demonstration program that uses the response.bi header to
' silently find the path of the current executable.
'
' TO COMPILE:
' fbc main.bas
' (The compiler will automatically find and include response.bi)
' =================================================================

' Include our custom header file.
' Now we can use the GetExecutablePath() function.

' --- MAIN PROGRAM ---
ScreenRes 800, 600, 32
Cls

Print "--- Locating Current Script Files (Silent Path Strategy) ---"
Print "------------------------------------------------------------"
Print
Print "Attempting to find the path of this running program..."
Sleep 1500

' Call the function from our header file.
' This is the "silent" part - no dialogs, no user input needed.
Dim currentPath As String = GetExecutablePath()

' Check the response
If currentPath <> "" Then
    Print "SUCCESS: The path has been identified using the OS-specific strategy."
    Print
    Print "Executable Path: "; currentPath
    Print
    Sleep 1000

    ' --- Example Use Case ---
    Print "Now, let's use this path to look for other script files..."
    Print
    
    Dim configFile As String = "strategies.txt"
    Dim fullConfigPath As String = currentPath & configFile
    
    Print "Checking for a configuration file at:"
    Print fullConfigPath
    Print
    
    ' FileExists is a function from the "dir.bi" header
    ' If FileExists(fullConfigPath) Then
    '     Print "RESPONSE: 'strategies.txt' was found! Ready to load."
    ' Else
    '     Print "RESPONSE: 'strategies.txt' was not found in the application directory."
    ' End If
Else
    Print "FAILURE: Could not determine the path of the current program."
    Print "The silent strategy failed on this system."
End If

Print
Print "------------------------------------------------------------"
Print "Program will exit in 10 seconds..."
Sleep 10000

End
' ```

' ### How to Compile and Run

' 1.  **Save Files:** Place both `response.bi` and `main.bas` in the same folder.
' 2.  **Compile:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to that folder, and run the compiler on the main `.bas` file:
'     ```sh
'     fbc main.bas
'     ```
'     The FreeBASIC compiler will automatically find and process the `#include "response.bi"` line. You do not need to compile `response.bi` separately.
' 3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program.
'     *   On Windows: `main.exe`
'     *   On Linux: `./main`

' When you run it, the program will print the directory where it is located, demonstrating that the silent, multi-strategy function in `response.bi` worked correctly.
